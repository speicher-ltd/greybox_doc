# Authentication

SPEICHER offers a number of ways to access data. One such way is logging in using your favorite web browser:

<%= image_tag "images/login.png" %>

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'speicher'

api = Speicher::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import speicher

api = speicher.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const speicher = require('speicher');

let api = speicher.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

SPEICHER uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new SPEICHER API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

SPEICHER expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

 
 
## Replace API key

You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
