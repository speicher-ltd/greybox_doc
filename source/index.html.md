# Introduction

Welcome to SPEICHER! You can use SPEICHER to solve a number of tasks, 
from stock management to Attendance and more.

We build SPEICHER on a battle tested foundation of Ruby, Rails, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, and a number of open source libraries. Most resources are accessible via REST API endpoints. We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

Allow us to briefly thank [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate). Slate is an open source tool for building documentation like this. 

## What to read - and when

This documentation is designed to offer support through every step of every workflow supported by SPEICHER. You could trawl through the entire thing front to back but we would rather have you use the service and dive into the documentation when needed. Usually you will be able to call up the documentation right at where you need it by using the hotkey combination: Alt-Shift-h
